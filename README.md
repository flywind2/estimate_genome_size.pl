NOTE
======
These scripts can be instructive for understanding how genome size is estimated from k-mer data. If you are looking for a more automated method for estimating genome size check out: http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/

NOTE
======
If after generating a plot, your plot has multiple peaks or no clear peaks, you likely have data with high heterozygosity and/or high duplication.  I have not looked further into interpreting the various characteristics of these plots, but if I were to find the time, i would:

1) simulate heterozygosity:
artificially add lots of heterozygosity to 2 or 3 copies of HumanChromosome22, then use the ART Illumina-sequence simulator to generate reads, and rerun the estimate_genome_size.pl script.  (perhaps run multiple times with increasing levels of "heterozygosity")

2) simulate gene duplication
take random chunks of HumanChromosome22 (totaling about 10% of the genome) and generate lots of reads on these chunks using the ART Illumina-sequence simulator, and rerun the estimate_genome_size.pl script.  (perhaps run again with 20% or doubling the amount of reads generated on the duplicates).

If you get patterns that look like your scatterplot, it is a decent indication of what is going on with your data.  If you do this and would like to share your findings, I would be happy to point to your github repo or post your data/results in a folder on this repo.

NOTE
======
VERSIONS 0.03 and below do not handle compressed files correctly and therefore give erroneous size estimations.  If you used uncompressed files, there is no problem.  this has been fixed in VERSION 0.04.  -- November 12, 2014

estimate_genome_size.pl
======

this is a suite of perl scripts to help estimate genome size from KMER distributions. It has been tested with the JELLYFISH program
http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/

The output looks something like:

    Estimated Coverage: 59.5 (60X) Estimated Genome Size: 1010144681.14286 (1GB)

DEPENDENCIES
------------

This module requires Perl

You will also want JELLYFISH:

    http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/

For the jellyplot program you will need gnuplot in your path:

A TYPICAL SESSION
------------

    # count k-mers (see jellyfish documentation for options)
    gzip -dc reads1.fastq.gz reads2.fastq.gz | jellyfish count -m 31 -o fastq.counts -C -s 10000000000 -U 500 -t 30 /dev/fd/0 
    
    # generate a histogram
    jellyfish histo fastq.counts_0 > fastq.counts_0.histo

    # generate a pdf graph of the histogram
    jellyplot.pl fastq.counts_0.histo

    # look at fastq.counts_0.histo.pdf and identify the approximate peak

    # use find_valleys.pl to help pinpoint the actual peak
    find_valleys.pl fastq.counts_0.histo

    # estimate the size and coverage
    estimate_genome_size.pl --kmer=31 --peak=42 --fastq=reads1.fastq.gz reads2.fastq.gz

IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT WORKS
------------

Simulate some next generation data based on an already-sequenced genome.
I used the program ART to do this with the Hydra magnipapillata genome:

http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/

    art_illumina --paired --in Hm_genomic.fa --out Hm_genomic_wildtype --len 100 --fcov 43 --mflen 180 --sdev 3.5
    
I also simulated perfect paired-end data with a sliding window. In both cases I recovered the correct coverage and size.
